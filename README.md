# Game-Of-Life

A simple [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation of customizable size.

Prerequisites
-------------
This program requires Java to compile and run.

Installation
------------

1. Download this repository and unzip the .zip file in your desired location.
2. Using the command line, navigate to \Game-Of-Life-master\src\life.
3. Compile the program using the command `javac Main.java`.

Usage
-----

Once the program is compiled, it can be run from the command line by navigating to \Game-Of-Life-master\src and using the command `java life.Main`. The program will open its own window with a board of the default size, 30.

Once running, Game Of Life offers the user several options. The yellow "Advance" button will advance the board to the next generation of the current simulation. The green "Play" button will cause the board to continuously advance generations, until the button is clicked again. The red "Reset" button will generate a new random board.

To select the size of the new board, type an integer in the field labeled "Set new size" and hit enter. Then click reset to get a new board of that size.
